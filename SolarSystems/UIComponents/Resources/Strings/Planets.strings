// MARK: - Planets
"Mercury.Name"  = "Mercury";
"Mercury.Title" = "Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its surface is filled with craters, and its temperatures vary greatly: It can reach up to 430°C during the day and drop to -180°C at night. It has almost no atmosphere, and its orbit is highly eccentric, sometimes very close and other times farther away from the Sun.";

"Venus.Name"    = "Venus";
"Venus.Title"   = "Venus is the second planet in the Solar System and is known as the 'evening star' or the 'morning star.' It is one of the hottest planets, with surface temperatures averaging around 450°C due to its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere. Despite traces of volcanic activity on its surface, detailed observations are hindered by a thick layer of clouds. Its rotation is slow, and its orbit is relatively smooth.";

"Earth.Name"    = "Earth";
"Earth.Title"   = "Earth is the third planet in the Solar System and is known as the 'blue planet.' It is the only known celestial body that hosts and supports various forms of life. It features a moderate climate with continents and oceans on its surface. Its atmosphere primarily consists of nitrogen and oxygen, providing suitable temperatures for the development of life. Earth's rotation and orbit allow for the creation of diverse climates and seasons.";

"Mars.Name"     = "Mars";
"Mars.Title"    = "Mars is the fourth planet in the Solar System and is known as the 'Red Planet.' It stands out with desert-like reddish soil and icy polar regions. It has a thin atmosphere with a high concentration of carbon dioxide. Its surface features massive mountains and a giant volcano. There is evidence indicating the presence of past water, fueling speculation about the possibility of past life. Mars' orbit and tilt contribute to the changing seasons.";

"Jupiter.Name"  = "Jupiter";
"Jupiter.Title" = "Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System and ranks fifth in position. Known as the 'Gas Giant,' it is composed primarily of gases like hydrogen and helium. It features prominent characteristics such as a massive atmospheric storm called the Great Red Spot. It has numerous moons, with Ganymede being recognized as the largest natural satellite in the Solar System. Jupiter also boasts a strong magnetic field and a distinct ring system.";

"Saturn.Name"   = "Saturn";
"Saturn.Title"  = "Saturn is the sixth planet in the Solar System and is renowned for its dazzling rings. It's a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Its rings are made up of ice and rock particles. With numerous moons, the largest being Titan, it possesses an atmosphere with a different chemical composition than Earth's. Saturn, along with its unique rings, stands out as a planet that captivates space enthusiasts' interest.";

"Uranus.Name"   = "Uranus";
"Uranus.Title"  = "Uranus is the seventh planet in the Solar System and stands out with its tilted orbit, rotating horizontally unlike other planets. Its surface clouds and atmospheric features, composed of elements like hydrogen, helium, and methane, make exploration and observation challenging. With several major moons and a ring system, Uranus is a planet that captures the interest of space enthusiasts.";

"Neptun.Name"   = "Neptune";
"Neptun.Title"  = "Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet in the Solar System. It is known as a gas giant. Its blue-colored atmosphere is composed of methane. The strongest winds are observed here. A giant dark spot known as the Great Dark Spot is a prominent feature. Triton, an unusually retrograde moon, is Neptune's largest moon. It has rings, but they are faint and difficult to observe.";
